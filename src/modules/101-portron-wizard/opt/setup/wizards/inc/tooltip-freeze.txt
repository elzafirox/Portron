This state is a generic, pure software, low-power state.
It allows more energy to be saved by freezing user space
and putting all devices into low-power states such that
the processors can spend more time in their idle states.

This state can be used for platforms without
Standby/Suspend-to-RAM support, or it can be used in 
addition to Suspend-to-RAM (memory sleep)
to provide reduced resume latency.
